# EE3320 Auto Controls - Virtual Simulink Lab Development
In Spring of 2020, during my final year as an undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Platteville, I was the Lab Assistant for Auto Controls (EE 3320).
When we were forced to go all online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was tasked with converting all of the in-person motor control labs into virtual equivalents using Simulink.
The lab instructions are included and the associated instructional walkthrough lectures can be found on my youtube channel:
