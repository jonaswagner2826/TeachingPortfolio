# MECH 1100 and MECH 1208 - Introduction to Mechanical Engineering 1 & 2
In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, I was a TA for the fully virtual offering of MECH 1100 and MECH 1208 at The University of Texas at Dallas.
My primary roles were around grading submitted assignments as well as answering any student questions.
I was also responsible for managing the course discussion boards to provide answers to all students.
I have included an example walk through on how to do a portion of that weeks AutoCAD assignment that I created to answer a student's discussion post question.

In Fall 2021, I am continuing as the TA for the MECH 1100 course with over 220 students.
Fortunately, the course is now in-person so the team-based lab course can be taught as designed.
Unfortunately, for the first two months our course was required to be held in a 'de-densification' state which limited the number of students in class and caused for a complete re-design of the first half of the semester.
Due to the lack of prior notice, this led to a lot of additional work 
This also removed the team aspect, so the result was double the number of assignments to grade each week.
